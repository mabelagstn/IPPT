# IPPT
The Individual Physical Proficiency Test (IPPT) is an annual fitness assessment for able-bodied Singaporean males who have completed or are undergoing compulsory military training (National Service). Introduced in 2015, the updated IPPT format evaluates physical fitness through three stations:

- Push-ups (upper body strength)
- Sit-ups (abdominal strength)
- 2.4km Run (cardiovascular and lower body strength)

Participants earn points based on their performance in each station, with scores varying by age. The final IPPT score is the sum of points from all three stations, determining whether they pass or fail. High achievers are rewarded with monetary incentives, categorized into Pass, Pass with Incentive, Silver, and Gold awards, encouraging soldiers to maintain peak physical fitness.

This project aims to use the data to determine a soldierâ€™s IPPT score and award.
